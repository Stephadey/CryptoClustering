# Crypto Clustering

## Overview

This project aims to cluster cryptocurrencies using K-means clustering algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. The goal is to analyse how cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `crypto_market_data.csv`, which contains various price change percentages of cryptocurrencies over different time periods.

## Steps

1. **Data Preparation**
    - Load and normalise the cryptocurrency market data.

2. **Elbow Method**
    - Determine the optimal number of clusters (k) using the Elbow method.

3. **K-means Clustering**
    - Cluster the cryptocurrencies using the K-means algorithm.
    - Visualise the clusters with scatter plots.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction**
    - Apply PCA to reduce the features to three principal components.
    - Re-evaluate the optimal number of clusters with PCA data.

5. **Compare Results**
    - Create composite plots to compare the Elbow curves and clusters from both the original and PCA-reduced data.
    - Analyse the impact of using fewer features for clustering.

## Results

- The optimal number of clusters is found to be 4.
- The total explained variance of the three principal components is approximately 0.895.
- PCA simplifies clustering, resulting in more distinct clusters.

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- hvplot
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Instructions

1. Install the necessary libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas hvplot matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```
2. Open the `Crypto_Clustering.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of K-means clustering and PCA to analyse and cluster cryptocurrencies based on their price changes. Reducing the number of features using PCA helps in creating more distinct and interpretable clusters.
